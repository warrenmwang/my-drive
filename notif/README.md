# Notification Service

Maintains a queue of long-running tasks like uploads and has the capability to email the user
when their long-running task is completed. Another usage of the notif. service is to email the
user when some of their intermediate reports that can be auto-generated are finished generating and
this will email those reports to the client. When the company compliance lawyers are done reviewing the
uploaded form information and documents, the lawyers can provide their feedback and whatnot to the app and
this service will be in charge of sending those to the client, again via email.
